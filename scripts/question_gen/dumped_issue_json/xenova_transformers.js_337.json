If I add a `/` at the start of the URL, it shouldn't add anything before that. A path that starts with `/` on the web always means \"append this to the origin\".\r\n\r\nSo I read the docs, and it seems to suggest that you need to put at `.` on the end:\r\n```js\r\nawait AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/.\")\r\n// requests: https://example.com/models/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/tokenizer.json \r\n```\r\nNope. So the next obvious step was to just give it an absolute URL and be done with it:\r\n```js\r\nawait AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"https://example.com/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ\")\r\n// requests:  'https://huggingface.co/https://example.com/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json\r\n```\r\nOof.\r\n\r\nSo I'm a bit confused here 😵‍💫\r\n\r\nGoing to keep trying, but I've spent 20 minutes on this so far, so posting here so you can improve the DX around this, even if I do manage to solve it myself soon.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOI9T9VM5ntnIg","author":{"login":"xenova"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"If your app is hosted on a different site as the models, the terminology I use is `remoteModels`:\r\n\r\nYou can try set `env.remoteHost` and/or `env.remotePathTemplate` (see [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/env#:~:text=Hugging%20Face%20Hub.-,remoteHost,-string))\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/assets/26504141/ce72a93e-8471-4d5d-b3e4-f38e455543bd)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese values default to:\r\n```\r\nremoteHost: 'https://huggingface.co/',\r\nremotePathTemplate: '{model}/resolve/{revision}/',\r\n```\r\n(see [code](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/blob/5b31129218e2f6ea001f8477a094f4f3f15a2502/src/env.js#L101-L102)).\r\n\r\nOpen to suggestions on how to improve DX :) ","createdAt":"2023-09-28T21:10:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/issues/337#issuecomment-1740010016","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOI9T9VM5ntnWd","author":{"login":"xenova"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"If your app is hosted on the same site as the models (terminology: `localModels`), then you can modify `env.localModelPath`.

Same with `blob:` and `data:` too I guess, since I did consider embedding the tokenizer files in the page for quicker load. Also it definitely seems like the default `localModelPath` path should just be empty rather than \"models\".
