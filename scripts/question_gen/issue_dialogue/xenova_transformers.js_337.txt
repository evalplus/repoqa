josephrocca(QUESTIONER) asks: My tokenizer files are hosted within this folder:
```
https://example.com/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/
```
First I load the lib:
```js
let { AutoTokenizer } = await import('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xenova/transformers@2.6.1');
```
Then I tried what I thought would be the most obvious/intuitive API:
```js
await AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ")
// requests: https://example.com/models/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/tokenizer.json
```
This is strongly counter-intuitive to me. If I add a `/` at the start of the URL, it shouldn't add anything before that. A path that starts with `/` on the web always means "append this to the origin".

So I read the docs, and it seems to suggest that you need to put at `.` on the end:
```js
await AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/.")
// requests: https://example.com/models/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/tokenizer.json
```
Nope. So the next obvious step was to just give it an absolute URL and be done with it:
```js
await AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("https://example.com/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ")
// requests:  'https://huggingface.co/https://example.com/public/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GPTQ/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json
```
Oof.

So I'm a bit confused here 😵‍💫

Going to keep trying, but I've spent 20 minutes on this so far, so posting here so you can improve the DX around this, even if I do manage to solve it myself soon.

The below is the discussion and comments on the question:

xenova(OWNER) replies: If your app is hosted on a different site as the models, the terminology I use is `remoteModels`:

You can try set `env.remoteHost` and/or `env.remotePathTemplate` (see [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/env#:~:text=Hugging%20Face%20Hub.-,remoteHost,-string))

These values default to:
```
remoteHost: 'https://huggingface.co/',
remotePathTemplate: '{model}/resolve/{revision}/',
```
(see [code](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/blob/5b31129218e2f6ea001f8477a094f4f3f15a2502/src/env.js#L101-L102)).

Open to suggestions on how to improve DX :)

xenova(OWNER) replies: If your app is hosted on the same site as the models (terminology: `localModels`), then you can modify `env.localModelPath`. It defaults to `/models/` as you see above.
```js
import { env } from '@xenova/transformers';
env.localModelPath = '/path/to/local/models/';
// subsequent requests will go to https://example.com/path/to/local/models/
```

josephrocca(QUESTIONER) replies: Ah, thanks! :pray:  I think the main DX improvement here would just be to mention that here where it says:

> A path to a *directory* containing tokenizer files, e.g., `./my_model_directory/.`:

![image](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/assets/1167575/4f0f42ac-f2de-46dd-a632-061edb4f3d0b)

Here's the line: https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/blob/main/src/tokenizers.js#L3812C11-L3812C11

I was going to make a quick pull request just now using the Github web editor but wasn't really sure on the wording here. Maybe something like "`env.localModelPath` will be prepended to the path" where `env.localModelPath` is also a link to https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/custom_usage ?

But I'd also vote for URLs starting with `/` and `https://` to be treated differently. Same with `blob:` and `data:` too I guess, since I did consider embedding the tokenizer files in the page for quicker load. Also it definitely seems like the default `localModelPath` path should just be empty rather than "models". That would have been another route to reducing confusion/friction for me here.

All of that said, I haven't thought about this long so don't weight these thoughts too much!
