Some users might like to use stricter warnings or treat warnings as errors in their code.  Exporting the includes as system libraries [should allow](https://foonathan.net/2018/10/cmake-warnings/#preventing-warnings-in-header-files) the compiler to ignore warnings generated when including `drogon` header files but I still got warnings after changing `drogon/CMakeLists.txt` in my submodule copy of `drogon` like so:
```diff
diff --git a/CMakeLists.txt b/CMakeLists.txt
index 0df11f1..dcb5c1a 100755
--- a/CMakeLists.txt

          $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/trantor>
```

As a workaround I did this in my `CMakeLists.txt`:
```CMake
add_subdirectory(drogon)

get_target_property(DROGON_INTERFACE_INCLUDES drogon INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)
add_library(drogon_incs INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(drogon_incs SYSTEM INTERFACE ${DROGON_INTERFACE_INCLUDES})

add_executable(${exe_target} ${exe_sources})
target_link_libraries(${exe_target} PRIVATE drogon_incs)
target_link_libraries(${exe_target} PRIVATE drogon)
target_compile_features(${exe_target} PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
target_compile_options(${exe_target} PRIVATE ${extra_warning_flags})
```

Ideally this workaround would not be needed, but I don't know enough about `CMake` to know why my local changes to `drogon/CMakeLists.txt` failed to work.

an-tao(MEMBER) replies: please change drogon/CMakeLists.txt as follows:

```diff
diff --git a/CMakeLists.txt b/CMakeLists.txt
index 0df11f1..c14aff7 100755
--- a/CMakeLists.txt

```

And then add drogon as a subdirectory

```cmake
 add_subdirectory(drogon)
 target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE drogon)
```

then you could set the compiler flag of your application like:

```
target_compile_options(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror)
```

gtorrico(QUESTIONER) replies: Thank you that worked!
